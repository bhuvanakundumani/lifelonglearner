Technovation Challenge 2018 

<p>My Technovation journey this year started off on ....2018. When we visited the school and informed the girls about the Technovation program they got really excited. 
We had to get the computer lab all set up and ready for them to strat working on their Apps. While we were setting up the infrastructure, we started forming teams. </p>

<p>It just took these 25 girls fifteen minutes to select their team members and form teams. We started brainstorming on the ideas - the problems that they wanted to solve. 
They came up with the following ideas - teaching basic computer application software in regional language, creating awareness about child abuse and providing support for the victims, videos demonstrating science experiments in class vi to Viii, quiz app for Math topics in grade 6, game/quiz to create an awareness on healthy food, game/quiz to inspire girls. They finalised the team name, team members, app idea and the name for their app.</p>

<p>We started spending two hours per week for training the girls. The girls had to be taught basic application software to begin with. They spent the first two weeks learning the basics in Paint, Notepad, Word, Excel and Powerpoint. Then we started with the basics of programming , App design and development. We started with the paper prototype of the design and started coding the app. The girls were eager to attend the sessions and all excited to see their final app.</p> 

<p>We spent a whole day working on the Pitch video , PPT and finalisation of the App. It was an awesome feeling to see their happy faces. </p>
